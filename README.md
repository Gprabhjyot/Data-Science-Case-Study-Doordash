# Data-Science-Case-Study-Doordash
Analyzed Original Data set from Doordash consisting 197428 rows of data and 16 variables. Developed a machine learning algorithm catering to the stakeholders' research to see what variables have the most impact on generating revenue.
For this project, we randomly sampled 5000 and 60000 rows from the original dataset for our analysis to have a more streamlined approach to the dataset. The historical.csv file is the dataset we have split our code into 4 separate Quarto Markdown Files-The Descriptive Statistics file consists of the summary table using the gt summary function, The Part 1 file consists of the Exploratory Data analysis as well as the MLR model developed with a sample size of 5000. The Part 2 file consists of the MLR model with a sample size of 60000. The Random Forest quarto markdown file contains the two random forest models created on a sample size of 5000 and 60000 respectively.
